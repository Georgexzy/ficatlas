"""
FicAtlas background worker.
===========================

Everything recurring that isn't a web request: the AO3 feed poll, the scheduled
crawls, and slow backfills.

Why a separate process rather than threads inside the API:

  * Heavy work competed with request handling. The scheduler ran in the API's own
    event loop, so a feed poll or crawl blocked the same loop serving searches.
  * Ad-hoc batches (`docker compose exec backend python …`) died whenever the API
    container restarted. That killed a dedup run and an enrichment run partway
    through during development — uvicorn's --reload restarts on any file change.

The API no longer starts the scheduler at all (it checks RUN_SCHEDULER), so
adding this container does not double up the polling.

Backfills are opt-in and paced deliberately. They exist to fill gaps slowly over
days, not to saturate the database or hammer archive.org:

  ENRICH_FFNET=true          walk FF.net stories missing metadata, via Wayback
  ENRICH_BATCH=200           stories per pass
  ENRICH_INTERVAL_MIN=30     minutes between passes
  DEDUP_CROSSPOSTS=true      merge newly-imported cross-posted duplicates
  DEDUP_INTERVAL_MIN=180
